## nvim-whid

`Whid` is a [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) plugin that displays files you've recently worked on in a floating window inside of the editor. The code in this repository was created using educational guides on learning Lua in order to improve my skills and development workflow. Please see this [comprehensive NeoVim Lua guide](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) if you are interested in learning about Lua as it pertains to NeoVim.

### Usage

To use `Whid`, you must meet two requirements:

1. Be in a NeoVim session
2. In a Git repository

If you meet these requirements, you simply need to execute `:Whid` which creates the floating windows.
